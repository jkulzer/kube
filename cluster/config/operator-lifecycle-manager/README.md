The CRDs for OLM need a different application because they are too large to work with the normal apply process. They need ServerSideApply, however this doesn't play nice with the defaults for the actual operator deployment. Therefore, the operator deployment gets this application without ServerSideApply enabled and the CRDs get the application `operator-lifecycle-manager-crds`. These two applications can be found in the 'kube/cluster/applications' directory.
